## Combat Abilities

RuneScape uses an ability system where you can cast abilities to damage
monsters, move around faster, or defence from incoming attacks. It can
feel daunting looking at your available abilities, but each one has a
tooltip that tells you what it does and how it can be used. The tooltip
can be viewed by hovering over the ability within the respective ability
book.

**Hint:** If you are using the **default interface** mentioned earlier
in the guide, many of your ability books will be found in the top
left of your screen. They can be dragged onto your action bars from there.

Let's cover this in detail.

## Ability Type

RuneScape has five types of abilities.

<SplitContent>
  <SplitItem width={50}>
    **Basic Ability:** Basic abilities generate adrenaline (base 8%)
    and will cast small to moderate damage. They can have unique
    effects, but are primarly used as a means of gaining adrenaline.

    They will be a large part of your rotation, so learning which basics
    are good to use in certain scenarios is very important.

  </SplitItem>
  <SplitItem width={50}>
    <img src="https://www.thersguide.com/compressed/abilities/wm2.jpg"
      alt="Wild Magic Ability Information" 
      style={{ 
        width: "100%", 
        height: "auto",
        maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />

  </SplitItem>
</SplitContent>

**Threshold Ability:** Threshold abilities are your next step up.
They will deal a moderate to large amount of damage. Every threshold
ability costs 15% adrenaline to use, but can only be cast when you have
over 50% adrenaline. <br />
For example, if you have 40% adrenaline, you cannot cast a threshold. If
you have 60% adrenaline, you can, and your adrenaline will go down to
45% when cast.

**Ultimate Ability:** Ultimate abilities are the most powerful
abilities and cost 100% adrenaline to use. There are different types of
ultimates, but the two main types are damage boosting ultimates and
damage dealing ultimates.

**Special Ability:** Finally, we have the special ability. This
classification is only given to weapon special attacks so its effect
will change based on your weapon.<br />
The special ability could be completely irrelevant, or it could be the
backbone of your rotation. Special attacks only appear on mid to high
tier weapons above level 60.

**Ability:** This classification is given to abilities that do not
fall into one of the other 4 classes. Movement abilities and most
Necromancy abilities fall into this class.

## Cooldown

<SplitContent>
  <SplitItem width={50}>
    A cooldown is the period of time an ability is unusable after it has
    been used and it can massively vary in length.

    Remember that RuneScape runs on a 0.6s [tick system](/getting-started/). This means
    that all cooldowns will be in increments of **0.6s**, for example, **20.4s**.

      alt="Wild Magic Cooldown Information"
      style={{ 
        width: "100%", 
        height: "auto",
        maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
  </SplitItem>
</SplitContent>

## Target

<SplitContent>
  <SplitItem>
    Below the cooldown timer is another type of classification which
    tells you how the ability targets foes.

    **Self-target:** These abilities are cast on your player.
    These include movement abilities, damage boosting ultimates, and
    some defensive abilities. Self-target abilities don't require a
    target and only affect your character.
  </SplitItem>

  <SplitItem>
      <img
      src="https://www.thersguide.com/compressed/abilities/wm4.jpg"
      alt="Wild Magic Target Information"
      style={{ 
        width: "100%", 
        height: "auto",
        maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
  </SplitItem>
</SplitContent>

**Single-target:** These abilities are, as the name implies,
cast on a single target and only affect that target.

**Area-target:** These abilities affect a certain
**area**, generally around the player or on a specified
location.

**Multi-target:** These abilities work a bit differently than
area-target abilities. They are cast on a target and spread to others
targets. They are **not bound** to an area in the same way
area-target abilities are.

## Description

<SplitContent>
  <SplitItem>
    The rest of the tooltip provides specific information about the
    ability. Every tooltip will have a short description, followed by
    the damage range of the ability, if applicable. This will consist of
    2 sets of numbers, actual damage numbers, and % numbers. The actual
    damage numbers will only show when you have a weapon of that style
    equipped.
  </SplitItem>

  <SplitItem>
    <img
      src="https://www.thersguide.com/compressed/abilities/wm5.jpg"
      alt="Wild Magic Tooltip Information"
      style={{ 
        width: "100%", 
        height: "auto",
        maxWidth: "100%"
        }}
    />
  </SplitItem>
</SplitContent>

The actual damage numbers will update in real time, but do not include
most buffs, while the % values will always remain the same. These can be
are a good source of damage.

Under the damage information, the tooltip will include all other
relevant information such as extra effects, number of hits, and
adrenaline cost.

## Requirements

<SplitContent>
  <SplitItem>
    At the very bottom of the tooltip are any requirements to cast the
    ability. This is generally a level requirement and an adrenaline
    requirement, but can include items or effects.
