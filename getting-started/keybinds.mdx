## Keybind Theory

As RuneScape is an ability bar based game, you can click-drag abilities and interactable
items onto your action bar and activate them via a keybind.

Keybinds are optional but are a beneficial tool used to better control your
inputs. While there are many uses for keybinds, they are most widely used for combat.

Many players bind things like food, overhead prayers, movement abilities
such as Surge, Escape, and Dive, and of course - combat abilities.

What you set your keybinds to is very much down to personal preference,
but the following guidelines can be used to help you with your decision making process.

## Minimize Hand Movement

The less your hand needs to move between inputs, the easier it is to
build muscle memory and reduce hand fatigue. This can be done by placing
frequently used abilities close to where your hand naturally rests. This
natural resting spot for your keyboard hand will be referred to as the
**Home Row**.

---

## Batch Similar Abilities

Many players choose to have a dedicated row for specific types of
bindable actions. For example, you may want to use a home row of
**Q, W, E, R, T** and **Y** for your most used
**Basic** abilities. Many combat styles have similarly
styled abilities, so you can reuse many of the same keybinds for similar
damage dealing abilities.

You can build out the rest of your keybinds around your home row to minimize hand
movement. The following batches of abilities are recommended:

## MMO Mouse Binds

Many players choose to use an MMO mouse with side buttons for RuneScape. This is not
needed, but can be a good way to balance out your keybinds between both hands. Many players
will bind food, potions, and movement abilities to their mouse.

## Modifier Keys

    To further minimize hand movement, you may consider utilizing a Modifier Key
    such as **Shift**, **Alt**, or **Control**.

    This allows you to use the same key for different actions by
    pressing the modifier key in conjunction with the main key. For
    example, the image shows each key of your **Home Row** being used for
    another ability with the modifier **Alt**, listed as **"a"** on keybinds.

## Practice Makes Perfect

Keybinds are hard! Building good habits and muscle memory can take time,
but as long as you've followed the previous principles, you'll be PvMing
in no time!
