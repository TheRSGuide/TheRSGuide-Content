description: Understanding RuneScape's tick system

How does the world work? The game runs on what we call
**ticks**, or **cycles**. Every **0.6** seconds, information is sent
between you and RuneScape's servers, keeping your character up to
date on what you're doing.

This is the core of understanding RuneScape, from your early levels all
the way to the end game. Whether you're catching a fish, or trying to
dodge an attack at a boss you'll be constantly interacting with these
**0.6** second intervals.

When using abilities it's worth getting used to the **Action Bar**.
This has a global cooldown of **1.8s**. This means you can conventionally
cast a new ability every **1.8s**, and abilities will spin around during this time.

    Because of the **0.6s** tick system, this means that a GCD consists of **3 ticks**.
    If you are manually using abilities, aim to press your next ability in the **green**
    section.

In addition, some players find there is significant delay in their inputs. While
this is not directly related to the **Tick system**, we recommend the following settings
to ensure smooth, responsive gameplay.

- Play on a server that is geographically close to your location
- When performing high input activities such as Combat, play on a
  world with **under 200** players.
