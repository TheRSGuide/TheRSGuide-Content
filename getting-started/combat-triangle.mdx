## Weakness

Weakness is one of the easiest ways to increase your damage output. This 
can be achieved by using a specific class like Ranged & Melee, or a specific 
weakness like Slash Weapons or Earth Spells.

With that being said, because the maximum hit damage potential you can 
have is 100%, if you have 100% hit chance without using using the target 
specific weakness, using the target's weakness will have no impact on your 
damage.
